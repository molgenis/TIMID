# TIMID
Scripts to process TIMID data

# Getting Started
This repository should make it possible to refresh the data on timid.gcc.rug.nl. 
Refreshing the data contains several steps:
- Preprocessing the raw data files (upload them to Molgenis) via a shell script;
- Combining the raw data in Molgenis with a Python script (available on timid.gcc.rug.nl).
