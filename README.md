# TIMID
TIMID model (EMX) and scripts to process new TIMID data.

# Getting Started
This repository should make it possible to refresh the data on timid.gcc.rug.nl. 
Refreshing the data contains several steps:
- Step 1: Preprocessing the raw data files (upload them to Molgenis) by using the script preprocess_raw_data.sh;
- Step 2: Combining the raw data in Molgenis with a Python script: ProcessData, which is available on timid.gcc.rug.nl.
